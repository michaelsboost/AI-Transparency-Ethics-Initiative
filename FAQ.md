# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)  

### 1. Why is open-source AI so important?  
Open-source AI ensures transparency, reduces the risk of monopolization, and allows experts worldwide to monitor and improve systems. Closed systems can be dangerous because they lack public oversight, making them more prone to misuse or hidden agendas.  

### 2. What are the biggest risks if these policies aren’t implemented?  
Without proper policies, AI and robotics could:  
- Violate data privacy and exploit user information.  
- Lead to mass unemployment without safety nets.  
- Be weaponized or make autonomous life-and-death decisions without human oversight.  
These policies aim to prevent these outcomes and promote ethical, sustainable development.  

### 3. How can I contribute if I’m not an AI expert?  
You don’t have to be an AI specialist to contribute! We welcome input on legal, environmental, economic, and societal aspects of AI policies. You can:  
- Suggest new policy ideas in the **Issues** tab.  
- Help refine existing sections for clarity and accuracy.  
- Share relevant research and resources.  

### 4. Will these policies be legally binding?  
No, this is an open-source proposal to inspire and guide policymakers. While not legally binding, it can influence local, national, and international policies.  

### 5. How do you ensure the accuracy of the information?  
We base our content on publicly available information, verified sources, and input from contributors. We encourage fact-based contributions and require citations for new additions.  

### 6. How can I report a Code of Conduct violation?
