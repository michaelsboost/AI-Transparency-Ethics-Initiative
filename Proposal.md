<details>  
<summary>Click to expand</summary>  

- **Transparency & Explainability**: AI decisions and robotics processes must be explainable and accessible for audits by third-party organizations to ensure public trust and impartiality.  
- **Open-Source AI Governance**: Critical AI systems should be open-source and community-regulated to prevent monopolization and malicious use.  
- **Human Rights First**: AI and robots must never override or compromise human autonomy, freedom, or well-being.  
- **Empathy & Bias Control**: All systems must undergo rigorous testing to reduce biases and ensure fairness across all demographics.  
- **AI Personhood Boundaries**: Define the rights and limitations of AI with potential sentience while prioritizing human safety.

<details>  
<summary>Click to expand</summary>  

- **Kill Switch & Emergency Shutdown**: Every advanced AI/robot must include a physical and software-based emergency shutdown accessible to multiple trusted parties.  
- **Non-Weaponization Rule**: Implement strict international bans on AI and robotics development for military use, with monitoring by a global regulatory body.  
- **EMP-Proof Public Infrastructure**: Prepare public infrastructure to withstand electromagnetic pulse (EMP) events to reduce vulnerability to sabotage or accidents.  
- **Autonomous Decision Restrictions**: Prohibit autonomous AI from making life-and-death decisions without human intervention.  
- **Data Privacy Protections**: Establish robust laws ensuring that AI and robotics cannot exploit user data or personal information without explicit consent.

## <a id="3-legal-policies"></a> 3. Legal Policies  
<details>  
<summary>Click to expand</summary>  

- **Global AI & Robotics Regulatory Body**: Create a global oversight organization to enforce ethical use and monitor compliance.  
- **Accountability Framework**: Develop clear liability policiesâ€”if AI or robots cause harm, their creators, operators, and users are held responsible based on their level of control.  
- **Robot Citizenship Boundaries**: Define what citizenship or rights (if any) should be given to highly advanced AI robots like Sophia.  
- **Labor Protection Laws**: Regulate robotics integration in industries to protect human workers from exploitation or mass unemployment.  
- **Ban on AI-Generated Deepfakes for Malicious Use**: Criminalize AI-generated content used for fraud, political manipulation, or slander.
